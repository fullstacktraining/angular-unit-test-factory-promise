# How to unit test an AngularJS factory method that returns a promise

There will be a blog post coming soon :)

To view the "app" put the repo on a webserver and look at `app/index.html`

To run the unit tests:

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm test`

If you don't already have it already you'll also need to install the Karma command line interface by running:

`npm install -g karma-cli`
